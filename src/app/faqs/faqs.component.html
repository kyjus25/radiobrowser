    <p-accordionTab header="How do I play stations?">
      <p>To play the stations, you need some media player software like:<p>
      <ul>
        <li>Winamp (Windows, OS X)</li>
        <li> VLC (Windows, Linux, Android, OS X)</li>
        <li>Clementine (Windows, Linux, OS X)</li>
        <li>many many more...</li>
        <li>yes, maybe Windows Media Player works too :)</li>
      </ul>
    </p-accordionTab>
    <p-accordionTab header="Can I contribute?">
      <p>Please help by fixing stations in the tab "broken". The stations there do not work at the present time.<br>
      If you do not know how to do that, please have a look at the tab "improve", and add more information to the stations like tags or country.<br>

    <p-accordionTab header="Why is my click not counted?">
      <p>I count only one click per ip aliress per station a day. Some people were clicking their favourite station 100s of times every day by using the programmers API.</p>
    </p-accordionTab>
    <p-accordionTab header="How often is every station checked?">
      <p>It depends on the overall number of stations in the database and if the station is currently marked as broken. Currently a cron job is run every 10 minutes which checks 50 working stations and 10 broken stations.</p>
    </p-accordionTab>
    <p-accordionTab header="In what order are the stations checked?">
      <p>The stations that were not checked for the longest time are checked first.</p>
    </p-accordionTab>
    <p-accordionTab header="Why are some stations marked as broken even when they are not?">
      <p>This can have multiple causes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Legal restrictions:<ul>
          <li>There may be some countries which have legal restrictions prohibiting your favourite station from broadcasting worldwide. It has to be possible to connect to it from my server which is located in Germany.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>High Costs:<ul>
          <li>Some others would allow global broadcast but let the stations pay huge amounts of money to copyright owners if they want to do that. Please talk to your station or your local political representative to ensure the freedom of global broadcasting.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Status not up to date:<ul>
          <li>Sometimes streams go down for some time. If the automatic check happens to be there at this exact time, they will be marked as broken. It will take some time that this station is checked again and marked as usable.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Bugs:<ul>
          <li>My program has a BUG :) If you think that is the case, please drop me a note or if you are a programmer, fix it on github.</li>
        </ul></li>
      </ul>
    </p-accordionTab>
    <p-accordionTab header="When will stations get deleted?">
      <p>There are 2 cases in which stations will get deleted automatically:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>New stations that never worked will get deleted after 3 days.</li>
        <li>Stations that did work at some point, but have not been working for at least 30 days now will get deleted.</li>
      </ul>
    </p-accordionTab>
    <p-accordionTab header="What is cached?">
      <p>The list of tags and the list of languages are calculated from the data. They are refreshed every 60 seconds.</p>
    </p-accordionTab>
    <p-accordionTab header="When did the project begin?">
      <p>The project began in December of 2015</p>

    <p-accordionTab header="I want to setup my own radiobrowser api server. How do I do that?">
