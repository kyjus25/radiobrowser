    <p-accordionTab header="How do I play stations?">
      <p>To play the stations, you need some media player software like:<p>
      <ul>
        <li>Winamp (Windows, OS X)</li>
        <li> VLC (Windows, Linux, Android, OS X)</li>
        <li>Clementine (Windows, Linux, OS X)</li>
        <li>many many more...</li>
        <li>yes, maybe Windows Media Player works too :)</li>
      </ul>
    </p-accordionTab>
    <p-accordionTab header="Can I contribute?">
      <p>Please help by fixing stations in the tab "broken". The stations there do not work at the present time.<br>
      If you do not know how to do that, please have a look at the tab "improve", and add more information to the stations like tags or country.<br>
        If you find bugs in this webpage, report them to <a href="https://github.com/segler-alex/radiobrowser" target="_blank">Github</a><br>
        If you find bugs in the webservice API, report them to <a href="https://github.com/segler-alex/radiobrowser-api" target="_blank">Github</a></p>

    <p-accordionTab header="Why is my click not counted?">
      <p>I count only one click per ip aliress per station a day. Some people were clicking their favourite station 100s of times every day by using the programmers API.</p>
    </p-accordionTab>
    <p-accordionTab header="How often is every station checked?">
      <p>It depends on the overall number of stations in the database and if the station is currently marked as broken. Currently a cron job is run every 10 minutes which checks 50 working stations and 10 broken stations.</p>
    </p-accordionTab>
    <p-accordionTab header="In what order are the stations checked?">
      <p>The stations that were not checked for the longest time are checked first.</p>
    </p-accordionTab>
    <p-accordionTab header="Why are some stations marked as broken even when they are not?">
      <p>This can have multiple causes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Legal restrictions:<ul>
          <li>There may be some countries which have legal restrictions prohibiting your favourite station from broadcasting worldwide. It has to be possible to connect to it from my server which is located in Germany.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>High Costs:<ul>
          <li>Some others would allow global broadcast but let the stations pay huge amounts of money to copyright owners if they want to do that. Please talk to your station or your local political representative to ensure the freedom of global broadcasting.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Status not up to date:<ul>
          <li>Sometimes streams go down for some time. If the automatic check happens to be there at this exact time, they will be marked as broken. It will take some time that this station is checked again and marked as usable.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Bugs:<ul>
          <li>My program has a BUG :) If you think that is the case, please drop me a note or if you are a programmer, fix it on github.</li>
        </ul></li>
      </ul>
    </p-accordionTab>
    <p-accordionTab header="When will stations get deleted?">
      <p>There are 2 cases in which stations will get deleted automatically:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>New stations that never worked will get deleted after 3 days.</li>
        <li>Stations that did work at some point, but have not been working for at least 30 days now will get deleted.</li>
      </ul>
    </p-accordionTab>
    <p-accordionTab header="What is cached?">
      <p>The list of tags and the list of languages are calculated from the data. They are refreshed every 60 seconds.</p>
    </p-accordionTab>
    <p-accordionTab header="When did the project begin?">
      <p>The project began in December of 2015</p>
    </p-accordionTab>
    <p-accordionTab header="I want to use the radio-browser api in my own app/program.">
      <p>You have the following possibilies:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the old variant which is for now in use at <a href="https://www.radio-browser.info/webservice">www.radio-browser.info</a>.</li>
        <li>Use the new system the following link which hands out redirects to second level servers: <a href="https://api.radio-browser.info">api.radio-browser.info</a></li>
        <li>Present your user with a list of second level servers, so that he can choose himself the one that is nearest/fastest.</li>
      </ul>
    </p-accordionTab>
    <p-accordionTab header="How do I get a list of second level servers?">
      <p>You have to do the following steps:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Do a dns lookup of all.api.radio-browser.info for all ip addresses. It will always return all available second level servers.</li>
        <li>Filter out doubles</li>
        <li>Do a reverse lookup for all remaining ips.</li>
        <li>Add "https://" in front of each of them.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>There are example implementations for <a href="/assets/serverlist.js">NodeJs</a> and <a href="/assets/serverlist.py">Python</a>.</p>
    </p-accordionTab>
    <p-accordionTab header="Do all radio-browser server support IPv6?">
      <p> In short: YES.<br/>
        If you have any problems, please contact me.</p>
    </p-accordionTab>
    <p-accordionTab header="I want to setup my own radiobrowser api server. How do I do that?">
      <p>You have 2 possibilies:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Use the old variant which is for now in use at www.radio-browser.info:<br/>
          There is a README at <a href="https://github.com/segler-alex/radiobrowser-api">radiobrowser-api</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use the new system at <a href="https://github.com/segler-alex/radiobrowser-api-rust">radiobrowser-api-rust</a> which
          powers the new second level servers. It will automatically mirror the main server because it supports federation. This
          is probably your easiest bet.
        </li>
      </ul>


      <p>Does radio-browser have some kind of federation network?</p>
      <p>
        The new api <a href="https://github.com/segler-alex/radiobrowser-api-rust">radiobrowser-api-rust</a> does have federation.<br/>
        The old one <a href="https://github.com/segler-alex/radiobrowser-api">radiobrowser-api</a> does not.
      </p>

      <p>What is the future plan for www.radio-browser.info?</p>
      <p>
        <u>Current State</u><br/>
        At the moment www.radio-browser.info/webservice is the only first level server hanping most users.<br/>
        There are some second level servers which already use the new style api and use federation to mirror the content of the first level server.<br/>
        For now stations are distributed from the first level server to the second level servers and NOT in the other direction.
        That means stations added to second level servers will not get distributed and will be deleted eventually.<br/><br/>
        <u>Future</u><br/>
        The server at www.radio-browser.info/webservice will be shut down eventually and the current second level servers
        will become the first level servers for other people to use and mirror.<br/>
        Stations can be aped to any one of the new first level servers and will be distributed among them.
      </p>


      <p>How does federation work?</p>
      <p>
        Every server does keep a station change history which does keep all apitions and changes.
        This can be pulled from other servers as a full version or as a differential from the state they already have.
        Each server also does keep a history of station checks, which can also be pulled in a similiar fashion.<br/><br/>
      </p>
      <u>TO BE DONE:</u><br/>
      <ul>
        <li>combine station checks fetched from multiple servers to an ultimate station online/offline state.</li>
      </ul>
